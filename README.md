# Description 
This is a cipher programme which is named as Caesar Cipher. Originally Caesar cipher is a really quite ancient type of encryption. So the story is, when Caesar wanted to send highly sensitive military messages, he would encode his message so that each letter would be shifted by a predetermined amount.

So the programme we are going to use can encode and decode the messages as it were done in ancient times.

# How to Run
* As the programme starts it will ask if you want to encode or decode the message, if you want to encode type encode or else type decode.
* Once you enter you can type your message and press enter, then to shift the alphabets specify the shift number.
* After specifying the shift number press enter and it will generate the result. If you want to encode or decode once more you can type yes or no accordingly and continue.
